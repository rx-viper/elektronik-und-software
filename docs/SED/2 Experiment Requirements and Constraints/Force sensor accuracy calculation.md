### From the science team requirements:
> 2.2.1.2 Penetration depth
> P.7: The penetration depth shall be measured with an accuracy of ±0.5 mm or lower.

∆s = 0.0005 m

### From the structure guys HPPM documentation:
> Federweg: 45-50 mm, Höchstkraft: 38,6 N

k = F / s = 38.6 N / 0.05 m = 772 N/m

Assumption: There might be a 10 times weaker spring

k /= 10 = 77.2 N/m

### Estimating the required force sensing accuracy

F = k * s
∆F = k * ∆s = 77.2 N/m * 0.0005 m = 0,0386 N
