// ToDo:
// Add F.X, P.X, D.X, O.X in front of everything
// find out the old numbers from the SED, match stuff and replace the X'es accordingly

## 2.1 Functional
    * The experiment shall measure the temperature distribution in each block of ice.
    * The pressure above each ice block shall be measured.
    * The penetration depth of the heat probes shall be measured.
    * All acquired data shall be stored on a reliable data storage device.
    * All acquired data except for the camera data shall be sent to the ground station via RXSM downlink.
    * The power for the heat probes shall be provided by NiMH batteries.
    * The power for the other electric components shall be provided by RXSM.
    * The electronics shall be as simple, robust and light weight as possible.

## 2.2 Performance
    #### Ice block temperature
    * The temperature in each ice block shall be measured by a 3x3 temperature sensor matrix.
    * The temperature sensors shall measure in a range of -60 to 0 °C or greater.
    * The temperature sensors shall measure with an accuracy of 0.5 °C or better.
    * The temperature data shall be acquired with a sample rate of 1 Hz or higher.

    #### Vapor pressure
    * The pressure shall be measured by differential pressure sensors.
    * The pressure sensors shall measure in a range of 0 to 5 mbar or greater.
    * The pressure sensors shall measure with an accuracy of 1 mbar or better.
    * The pressure data shall be acquired with a sample rate of 20 Hz or higher.

    #### Heat probe penetration depth
    * The penetration depth shall be measured indirecly using force sensors on each spring-loaded heat probe.
    * The force sensors shall measure in a range of 0 to 10 N.
    * The force sensors shall measure with an accuracy of 33 mN or better.
    * The force data shall be acquired with a sample rate of 2 Hz or higher.

    #### Power supply
    * The batteries shall provide 180 W of power for at least 3 min of experiment time.
    * The total power consumption shall be below 200 W.

    #### Data storage
    * There shall be enough storage for 30 min of data acquisition.
    * All data shall be stored with a redundancy factor of 2 or more.

## 2.3 Design
    * The data rate sent to the RXSM for downlink shall be below 20 kbit/s.
    * There shall be no electrical connection of electronic components to the rocket structure.
    * No electronics shall be enabled during radio silence.

## 2.4 Operational
    * The battery’s temperature shall not exceed the operational window.
    * The heat probes shall be turned off in case of over heating.
    * The experiment shall accept a request for radio silence at any time while on the launch pad.
    * The experiment shall be able to conduct measurements autonomously in case connection with the ground segment is lost.
    * The experiment shall be able to enter a secure mode after landing (pyros and sensitive equipment shall be disabled).
